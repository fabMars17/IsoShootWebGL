# IsoShoot

A simple and short Shoot'em up in 3d isometric view, playable in browser.

Made with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

This was my very first programming and video game project attempt (2014).

It was a full self-learning coding, from basic knowledge javascript and how 3d engine is working.

3D modeling, design, concept made by me.
